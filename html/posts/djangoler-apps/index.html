        <p>This the <strong>Djangoler</strong> project. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/12-startups-in-12-months-how-this-digital-nomad-doing-it">12 startups in 12 months</a>
by Peter Levels, and other indie hackers approach to build MVPs to test

<h1 id="avoiding-shiny-tech">Avoiding &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; tech.<a href="#avoiding-shiny-tech" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I am an engineer, currently working in a medium sized company, where I work
with <strong>Go</strong>, using containers, deploying to kubernetes clusters, and with
dedicated frontend, backend and systems engineers.</p>
<p>However, for this project I want to use a software stack that allows me
to build web apps productively. I will use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Django</strong>: for the backend development (also for rendering some pages from templates)</li>
<li><strong>Bootstrap 3</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong>: even those are <em>obsolete</em> technologies, they fit my
abilities as a frontend programmer.</li>
<li><strong>Ansible</strong>: in order to deploy my MVPs to simple <strong>VM</strong>, that will run everything
required. Don&rsquo;t want to lose time in infrastructure stuff. (I will be happy if
at some point something doesn&rsquo;t fit modern VM&rsquo;s capacities).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, since I am currently employed, my dedication to the project will be a couple
of hours daily (perhaps a little bit more on weekends), because I want to avoid
any burnout.</p>
<h1 id="learning-how-to-promote-and-marketing-the-mvps">Learning how to promote and marketing the MVPs<a href="#learning-how-to-promote-and-marketing-the-mvps" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>In the past I&rsquo;ve already tried to create some products, and I used the classic
&ldquo;engineer approach&rdquo; where I kept building features, without any validation about who
would be interested int them. Once finished I struggled to find someone that would
pay for them.</p>
<p>With the <strong>Djangoler</strong> apps I want to address that: build small reusable MVPs,
get feedback about them, and modify them to fit any needs or just abandon them
in the wild.</p>
<h2 id="from-scratch">From scratch<a href="#from-scratch" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The idea is to start from a clean slate. New accounts everywhere: email, twitter,
github, and so one. And keep the <strong>Djangoler</strong> project separate from
all my previous background.</p>
<h3 id="but-with-code-reuse">But with code reuse&hellip;<a href="#but-with-code-reuse" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Some of the things that want to build are ideas that I have already written down,
for some of them I even bought the domains, and for some others ideas I have libraries
that I can reuse.</p>
<p>Also I am going to use the same UI / Bootstrap theme everywhere, and if at some
point any of them deserves an unique design (people starts liking it) I will
update that.</p>
<h1 id="weekly-updates">Weekly updates<a href="#weekly-updates" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Since I do not have a lot of time, I will just try to write an update every week.</p>
